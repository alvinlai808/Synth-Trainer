Excellent work, guys!

I like your reasoned discussion of time vs. cost in problem one.  You make a
good point for combining requirement and design in problem two, although due
to them being so intertwined there is some of each that would go on in both
phases if they are discrete.

Don't forget about "deployment" phase in problem three.  The fact is that the
maintenance phase on a large project will consume 70% to 80% of the project's
total cost, so pulling the deployment activity out of that can be a savings.

You make a good case for big user stories [which are known as "epics"]!

Thank you for your insight and thoughtful answers to eight, nine, and ten.


Great work on this.
