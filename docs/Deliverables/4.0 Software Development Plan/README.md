CMSI 401 project ~~ Fall 2020
Jeremy Goldberg, Alvin Lai, David Sackler, Andrey Varakin
Synth Trainer project
=================================
Presentation:
   a lovely job on the presentation!  you all knew your parts and you spoke
   authoritatively about your project and what it can do.  ADSR envelopes are
   a great way to train your ear to recognize different sounds.  I've played
   with MiniMoog, Korg, and Arp synthesizers, and they have SO MUCH sonic
   capacity ~ you can make any sound with them!  the graphics in the slides
   were great, and show ADSR functionality quite clearly.  you also gave us
   a good idea of what you have planned and included extensions.  you did a
   great job on this.

Proposal Document:
   your proposal document is well-executed and very clear.  I'm really looking
   forward to this project's successful completion and demonstration!

=============================================================================
Great work on this presentation and proposal!

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus
