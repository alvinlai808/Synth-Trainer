========================================================================================
Excellent work on this deliverable!  I like the way you have presented the
project description, and the interfaces are described well from the users'
perspective.

One thing to consider is, in section 6.1.2.2 there are other interfaces in
this section besides just the user interfaces.  For example, HOW does the
software communicate with the database; what are the API interface data
structures like for the "tone.js" library?  At the architecture level, you
don't need to describe the details of e.g., the fields of a JSON object, but
you should at least say it will use JSON objects.

I noticed that both your diagram links go to the same drawing image... not a
problem when I can just go to the img directory and bring it up, but it's a
good lesson to let you know ~ always verify that links work properly before
you release the work product!  *grin*

The user manual is great
