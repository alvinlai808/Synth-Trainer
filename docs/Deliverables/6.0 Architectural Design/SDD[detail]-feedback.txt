Architectural Design Section:
-----------------------------
Excellent work on this deliverable!  I like the way you have presented the
project description, and the interfaces are described well from the users'
perspective.

One thing to consider is, in section 6.1.2.2 there are other interfaces in
this section besides just the user interfaces.  For example, HOW does the
software communicate with the database; what are the API interface data
structures like for the "tone.js" library?  At the architecture level, you
don't need to describe the details of e.g., the fields of a JSON object, but
you should at least say it will use JSON objects.

I noticed that both your diagram links go to the same drawing image... not a
problem when I can just go to the img directory and bring it up, but it's a
good lesson to let you know ~ always verify that links work properly before
you release the work product!  *grin*

The user manual is great

Detailed Design Section:
------------------------
Not bad!!  This project is a little difficult to document, since much of it
is going to be audio sounds that happen in response to the user's control.
However, since part of what you described is the ability to play back some
specific sounds, I don't see how those are stored in your database tables,
at least not in the design.  If I were on the development team, I would need
a bit more information than what is presented here.  Still, the user's
manual is descriptive and helps with understanding how to run things.

All in all, nice job!

         Note that the "CDR presentation is folded into "ABCDR"
            so the 15% reflects 10% for detail and 5% for CDR
