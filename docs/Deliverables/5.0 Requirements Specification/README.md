## **5.1** - Introduction

Synth Trainer is aimed to be an ear trainer for beginner electronic music producers. The goal of the application is to train artists to recognize sounds by their timbres and characteristics so that they can recreate sounds from their favorite songs or fleeting ideas that they may not have been able to create before. Is a sound made with sine, square, sawtooth, or triangle waves? What are the values of the ADSR(attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope? 

Dedicated ear training applications exist for things like equalization and audio compression, but there seem to be no current programs tailored towards sound synthesis. Synth Trainer will include a basicsynthesizer interface which contains various components such as an oscillator for basic waveshapes (sine,square, sawtooth, and triangle) and an ADSR envelope. The program will produce random sounds basedon the components given to the user, which the user will then attempt to recreate while solely relying onthe ears. Once the user submits his/her sound, the program then reveals the settings of the randomly generated sound.
